This guide will walk you through creating your first full-stack AI application with deco. In under 10 minutes, you'll have a working app with tools, workflows, and a custom UIâ€”all deployed to production.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** v22+ ([download here](https://nodejs.org)) or **Bun** v1.0+ ([download here](https://bun.sh))
- **Git** for version control
- **Code editor** (we recommend [Cursor](https://cursor.com) for AI-powered development)
- **Basic TypeScript knowledge** â€“ deco is TypeScript-first, so familiarity with TS is helpful

</Callout>

## Create Your First App

<StepGroup>
  <Step number={1} title="Initialize your project">
    ```bash
    npm create deco@latest
    # or with bun
    bun create deco@latest
    ```

    This will:
    - Open your browser to authenticate (create an account if you don't have one)
    - Prompt you to select or create a workspace
    - Generate a new project from a template
    - Link the project to your workspace

    Choose a project name that describes your app (e.g., `customer-support-agent`).
  </Step>

  <Step number={2} title="Install dependencies">
    ```bash
    cd <your-app-name>
    npm install
    # or with bun
    bun install
    ```

    This installs all dependencies for both the backend (MCP server) and frontend (React app).
  </Step>

  <Step number={3} title="Start development server">
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or with bun
    bun dev
    ```
    
    Your app's local server will start with hot reload enabled. You'll see two URLs:
    - **Local URL**: `http://localhost:8787` (your React UI)
    - **Preview URL**: `https://localhost-abc123.deco.host` (publicly accessible)
    
    The server serves:
    - **React app** at `/` (your custom UI)
    - **MCP server** at `/mcp` (tools and workflows for AI agents)
  </Step>
</StepGroup>

<Callout type="success">
  Your full-stack AI app is now running locally! ðŸŽ‰
</Callout>

## Explore Your App

Your generated project includes:

### Backend (`/server`)
- **`main.ts`** â€“ Server entry point that defines your MCP server
- **`tools/`** â€“ Tool definitions (API calls, database queries, computations)
- **`workflows/`** â€“ Workflow orchestrations
- **`schema.ts`** â€“ Database schema (Drizzle ORM with SQLite)

### Frontend (`/view`)
- **`src/routes/`** â€“ Page components (TanStack Router)
- **`src/components/`** â€“ Reusable UI components (shadcn/ui)
- **`src/lib/rpc.ts`** â€“ Typed RPC client to call backend tools/workflows

<Callout type="info">
  The frontend and backend share types through `deco.gen.ts`, giving you end-to-end type safety.
</Callout>

## Test Your App

### Option 1: Test the React UI

Open `http://localhost:8787` in your browser. The default template includes a simple UI that demonstrates calling backend tools.

### Option 2: Test with AI Agents

Connect your MCP server to the deco admin to test with AI agents:

1. Go to [admin.decocms.com](https://admin.decocms.com)
2. Navigate to your workspace
3. Click **Integrations** â†’ **Add Integration** â†’ **Custom Integration**
4. Paste your preview URL + `/mcp` (e.g., `https://localhost-abc123.deco.host/mcp`)
5. Save and test the default tools in the AI chat interface

<Callout type="info">
  AI agents can now discover and call your tools. The UI and agents share the same backendâ€”no duplicate APIs to build.
</Callout>

## Make Your First Changes

Let's add a simple tool to see the full-stack development experience:

### 1. Add a Tool

Edit `server/tools/index.ts`:

```typescript
import { createTool } from "@deco/workers-runtime";
import { z } from "zod";

export const createGreetingTool = (env: Env) =>
  createTool({
    id: "GREETING",
    description: "Generate a personalized greeting",
    inputSchema: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      language: z.enum(["en", "es", "pt"]),
    }),
    outputSchema: z.object({
      greeting: z.string(),
    }),
    execute: async ({ context }) => {
      const greetings = {
        en: `Hello, ${context.name}!`,
        es: `Â¡Hola, ${context.name}!`,
        pt: `OlÃ¡, ${context.name}!`,
      };
      return { greeting: greetings[context.language] };
    },
  });

export const tools = [
  createGreetingTool,
  // ... other tools
];
```

### 2. Generate Types

```bash
npm run gen:self
```

This regenerates `deco.gen.ts` with your new tool's types.

### 3. Use in Frontend

Edit `view/src/routes/home.tsx`:

```tsx
import { client } from "../lib/rpc";
import { Button } from "../components/ui/button";
import { useState } from "react";

function HomePage() {
  const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState("");

  const handleGreeting = async () => {
    const result = await client.tools.GREETING({
      name: "World",
      language: "en",
    });
    setGreeting(result.greeting);
  };

  return (
    <div className="p-8">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">My First AI App</h1>
      <Button onClick={handleGreeting}>Say Hello</Button>
      {greeting && <p className="mt-4">{greeting}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 4. See It Live

Save your changes. The dev server will hot-reload. Open `http://localhost:8787` and click the button!

<Callout type="success">
  You just built a full-stack feature: backend tool + frontend UI. No REST APIs, no integration codeâ€”just TypeScript.
</Callout>

## Deploy to Production

When you're ready to deploy:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- Build your React app for production
- Bundle your MCP server
- Deploy everything to Cloudflare Workers
- Make your app available at `https://<your-app>.deco.page`

Your full-stack app is now live! Both the UI and MCP server are deployed together.

<Callout type="info">
  After deployment, your app appears in your workspace's private registry. Team members can install it instantly.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

Now that you have a working app, explore the core capabilities:

- **[Creating Tools](/en/guides/creating-tools)** â€“ Build tools that agents and UIs can call
- **[Building Workflows](/en/guides/building-workflows)** â€“ Orchestrate multi-step automations
- **[Building Views](/en/guides/building-views)** â€“ Create custom React interfaces
- **[Project Structure](/en/project-structure)** â€“ Understand how the codebase is organized
- **[Integrations](/en/guides/integrations)** â€“ Connect to external APIs and services

## Development Workflow

As you develop, keep these commands handy:

```bash
# Start development server (hot reload)
npm run dev

# Regenerate types after adding integrations
npm run gen

# Regenerate types for your own tools/workflows
npm run gen:self

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy

# Add integrations (Gmail, Slack, etc.)
deco add
```

<Callout type="tip">
  Run `npm run gen:self` after adding tools or workflows to get updated types in your frontend.
