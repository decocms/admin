The `deco` CLI provides commands for managing your full-stack AI applications. This guide covers the essential commands for development, deployment, and code synchronization workflows.

## Installation

The CLI is installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g deco-cli
# or with bun
bun install -g deco-cli
```

Verify installation:

```bash
deco --version
```

## Authentication

### Login

Authenticate with deco:

```bash
deco login
```

This opens your browser to complete authentication. Once logged in, your session is stored locally.

### Check Session

View your current session:

```bash
deco whoami
```

### Logout

Clear your local session:

```bash
deco logout
```

## Project Management

### Create a New Project

Initialize a new deco project:

```bash
deco create
# or
npm create deco@latest
```

This will:
- Prompt you to authenticate (if not logged in)
- Let you select or create a workspace
- Generate a project from a template
- Link the project to your workspace

### Configure an Existing Project

Link an existing project to a workspace:

```bash
deco configure
```

This saves workspace configuration locally so other commands know which workspace to use.

## Development

### Start Development Server

Start the local development server with hot reload:

```bash
deco dev
# or
npm run dev
```

This starts:
- **Backend** (MCP server) on port `8787`
- **Frontend** (React app) at `/`
- **Hot reload** for both backend and frontend changes

The CLI also provides a **publicly accessible preview URL** (e.g., `https://localhost-abc123.deco.host`) so you can test from any device or share with team members.

<Callout type="info">
  The preview URL is tunneled through deco infrastructure and is automatically secured. It's perfect for testing integrations or sharing work-in-progress.
</Callout>

### Generate Types

After adding integrations or tools, regenerate types:

```bash
# Generate types for external integrations
deco gen
# or
npm run gen

# Generate types for your own tools/workflows
deco gen --self <your-preview-url>/mcp
# or
npm run gen:self
```

The `gen` command creates `deco.gen.ts` with typed interfaces for:
- **External integrations** (Gmail, Slack, etc.) added via `deco add`
- **Your own tools/workflows** (when using `--self`)

<Callout type="tip">
  Run `npm run gen:self` after adding or modifying tools/workflows to get updated types in your frontend.
</Callout>

## Deployment

### Deploy to Production

Deploy your full-stack app to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
deco deploy
# or
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- Build your React app for production
- Bundle your MCP server
- Deploy both to Cloudflare Workers
- Make your app available at `https://<your-app>.deco.page`

Options:

```bash
# Deploy to a specific workspace
deco deploy -w <workspace>

# Deploy a specific app
deco deploy -a <app-name>

# Skip confirmation
deco deploy -y

# Make app public in marketplace
deco deploy --public

# Dry run (show what would be deployed)
deco deploy --dry-run
```

### List Apps

View all apps in your workspace:

```bash
deco hosting list
# or
deco hosting list -w <workspace>
```

### Promote a Deployment

Promote a specific deployment to a route:

```bash
deco hosting promote -d <deployment-id> -r <route-pattern>
```

## Integrations

### Add Integrations

Add external services to your project:

```bash
deco add
```

This opens an interactive prompt where you can browse and install integrations (Gmail, Slack, Notion, etc.). After installation:

1. Run `npm run gen` to generate typed clients
2. Use integrations in your tools via `env.<INTEGRATION_NAME>`

<Callout type="success">
  Integrations are automatically configured in your `wrangler.toml` with proper OAuth scopes and bindings.
</Callout>

## Code Synchronization (Deconfig)

The `deco deconfig` commands let you sync code between your local machine and deco-hosted branches. This is useful for:

- **Collaborative development** – Multiple developers working on the same codebase
- **Code backup** – Store your code remotely
- **Version control** – Manage multiple branches

<Callout type="info">
  **Deconfig** is deco's file synchronization system, similar to Git but optimized for the platform. It works alongside Git—use Git for version control, use Deconfig for deployment and collaboration within deco.
</Callout>

### Clone a Branch

Clone a remote branch to your local machine:

```bash
deco deconfig clone -b <branch-name> --path <local-directory>
```

Example:

```bash
# Clone the 'main' branch to ./my-project
deco deconfig clone -b main --path ./my-project
```

This downloads all files from the remote branch to your local directory.

### Push Local Changes

Push your local code to a remote branch:

```bash
deco deconfig push --path <local-directory> -b <branch-name>
```

Example:

```bash
# Push ./my-project to the 'main' branch
deco deconfig push --path ./my-project -b main
```

This works like `rsync`:
- Compares local files with remote files (via hashes)
- Uploads only changed files (new or modified)
- Respects `.deconfigignore` patterns (similar to `.gitignore`)

Built-in ignore patterns:
- `node_modules/`
- `.git/`
- `.deconfig/`
- `.DS_Store`
- `*.tmp`, `*.temp`
- `.env.local`

<Callout type="tip">
  Create a `.deconfigignore` file to exclude additional files:
  
  ```
  # .deconfigignore
  *.log
  /temp
  build/
  !important.txt
  ```
</Callout>

#### Watch Mode

Automatically push changes as you edit:

```bash
deco deconfig push --path ./my-project -b main --watch
```

This monitors your directory and pushes changes automatically (with 500ms debounce).

#### Dry Run

See what would be pushed without making changes:

```bash
deco deconfig push --path ./my-project -b main --dry-run
```

### Pull Remote Changes

Pull changes from a remote branch to your local directory:

```bash
deco deconfig pull --path <local-directory> -b <branch-name>
```

Example:

```bash
# Pull 'main' branch to ./my-project
deco deconfig pull --path ./my-project -b main
```

This downloads remote changes and overwrites local files. Use with caution if you have uncommitted work.

#### Dry Run

See what would be changed without applying:

```bash
deco deconfig pull --path ./my-project -b main --dry-run
```

### List Files in a Branch

Browse files in a remote branch:

```bash
deco deconfig list -b <branch-name>
```

This opens an interactive file browser where you can:
- Navigate directories
- View file contents
- Filter by path patterns

### Watch a Branch for Changes

Monitor a remote branch for changes:

```bash
deco deconfig watch -b <branch-name> --path <path-filter>
```

Example:

```bash
# Watch for changes to .ts files in server/
deco deconfig watch -b main --path "server/**/*.ts"
```

This prints change events in real-time (useful for CI/CD pipelines).

### Get a Single File

Download a single file from a remote branch:

```bash
deco deconfig get <file-path> -b <branch-name> -o <output-file>
```

Example:

```bash
# Download server/main.ts to ./main.ts
deco deconfig get server/main.ts -b main -o ./main.ts
```

### Put a Single File

Upload a single file to a remote branch:

```bash
deco deconfig put <remote-path> -b <branch-name> -f <local-file>
```

Example:

```bash
# Upload ./main.ts to server/main.ts
deco deconfig put server/main.ts -b main -f ./main.ts
```

### Delete a File

Delete a file from a remote branch:

```bash
deco deconfig delete <file-path> -b <branch-name>
```

Example:

```bash
# Delete server/main.ts from main branch
deco deconfig delete server/main.ts -b main
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Deletion detection is not yet implemented for `push` command. Files deleted locally will remain on the remote branch until manually deleted with `deco deconfig delete`.
</Callout>

## Tool Execution

### Call a Tool

Execute a tool directly from the CLI:

```bash
deco call-tool <tool-name> -i <integration-id> -p '<json-payload>'
```

Example:

```bash
# Call SEND_EMAIL tool
deco call-tool SEND_EMAIL -i my-app -p '{"to":"user@example.com","subject":"Hello","body":"World"}'
```

You can also use `--set` for individual fields:

```bash
deco call-tool SEND_EMAIL -i my-app --set to=user@example.com --set subject=Hello --set body=World
```

<Callout type="info">
  This is useful for testing tools without opening the UI or writing test code.
</Callout>

## Link (Local Tunneling)

Create a public tunnel to your local server:

```bash
deco link -p <port> [command]
```

Example:

```bash
# Tunnel existing server on port 3000
deco link -p 3000

# Start server and tunnel simultaneously
deco link -p 8787 npm run dev
```

This creates a public URL that tunnels to your local port—perfect for testing webhooks or sharing local development with others.

## Updating

### Upgrade CLI

Update the `deco-cli` package to the latest version:

```bash
deco upgrade
```

### Update Dependencies

Update deco dependencies in your project:

```bash
deco update
```

This updates `@deco/*` packages to their latest versions.

## Common Workflows

### Initial Setup

```bash
# 1. Install CLI
npm install -g deco-cli

# 2. Login
deco login

# 3. Create project
deco create my-app

# 4. Start development
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Development Loop

```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Make changes to tools/workflows
# Edit server/tools/my-tool.ts

# 3. Regenerate types
npm run gen:self

# 4. Use in frontend
# Edit view/src/components/MyComponent.tsx
```

### Deployment Workflow

```bash
# 1. Test locally
npm run dev

# 2. Deploy to production
npm run deploy

# 3. Verify deployment
deco hosting list
```

### Collaborative Development

```bash
# Developer A pushes changes
deco deconfig push --path . -b main

# Developer B pulls changes
deco deconfig pull --path . -b main

# Developer B makes changes and pushes
deco deconfig push --path . -b main
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Not logged in" error

Run `deco login` to authenticate.

### "Workspace not configured" error

Run `deco configure` to link your project to a workspace.

### Types are out of sync

Run `npm run gen` after adding integrations, or `npm run gen:self` after changing tools/workflows.

### Preview URL not working

Ensure your dev server is running (`npm run dev`) and check firewall settings.
