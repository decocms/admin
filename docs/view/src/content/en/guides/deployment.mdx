Deploying a deco app is **remarkably simple** compared to traditional setups. Your entire full-stack app—backend (MCP server), frontend (React UI), database, and assets—deploys together to Cloudflare's global edge network with a single command.

<Callout type="success">
  **One command, full deployment**: `npm run deploy` bundles and deploys your backend, frontend, and database together. No separate Vercel + Railway setup, no CORS configuration, no environment synchronization—just one unified deployment.
</Callout>

## Quick Deploy

Deploy your app in one command:

```bash
npm run deploy
# or with bun
bun run deploy
```

That's it! Your full-stack app is now live at `https://<your-app>.deco.page`.

## What Gets Deployed

When you run `npm run deploy`, the following happens:

### 1. Frontend Build

Vite builds your React app for production:
- Minifies JavaScript and CSS
- Optimizes images and assets
- Creates production-ready bundles in `view/dist/`

### 2. Backend Bundle

Your MCP server is bundled with all dependencies:
- TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript
- Tools and workflows are included
- Database schema is bundled
- External integrations are configured

### 3. Upload to Cloudflare

Everything is uploaded to Cloudflare Workers:
- **Worker script**: Your MCP server code
- **Static assets**: Your React app (HTML, JS, CSS, images)
- **Durable Objects**: For workflow execution state
- **SQLite database**: Isolated per workspace

### 4. Public URL

Your app is immediately live at:
- **Production URL**: `https://<your-app>.deco.page`
- **MCP endpoint**: `https://<your-app>.deco.page/mcp` (for AI agents)
- **UI**: `https://<your-app>.deco.page/` (for users)

<Callout type="info">
  **Same runtime, same context**: Your deployed app serves both the UI (at `/`) and the MCP server (at `/mcp`) from the same Cloudflare Worker. This means zero network latency between frontend and backend—they're literally the same process.
</Callout>

## Deployment Options

### Basic Deployment

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Deploy to Specific Workspace

```bash
deco deploy -w <workspace-name>
```

### Deploy with Specific App Name

```bash
deco deploy -a <app-name>
```

### Skip Confirmation

```bash
deco deploy -y
```

### Publish to Marketplace

Make your app public so others can install it:

```bash
deco deploy --public
```

<Callout type="tip">
  Published apps appear in the deco marketplace. Other teams can install them with one click, including all tools, workflows, and UIs.
</Callout>

### Dry Run

See what would be deployed without actually deploying:

```bash
deco deploy --dry-run
```

## Authentication

Deployment requires authentication. Run `deco login` if you haven't already:

```bash
deco login
```

For CI/CD pipelines, use an API token:

```bash
deco deploy -t <your-api-token>
```

Generate API tokens in your workspace settings at [admin.decocms.com](https://admin.decocms.com).

## Cloudflare Workers Runtime

Your app runs on **Cloudflare's global edge network**, providing:

### Automatic Scaling
- Zero configuration—scales from 0 to millions of requests automatically
- No provisioning, no capacity planning, no servers to manage

### Global Performance
- Low latency worldwide—your app runs at 300+ locations
- Requests route to the nearest data center automatically

### Cost Efficiency
- Pay only for what you use (requests and compute time)
- Free tier includes 100,000 requests/day

### Isolation & Security
- Each workspace gets an isolated environment
- SQLite database is isolated per workspace
- Environment variables are encrypted at rest

<Callout type="info">
  **Cloudflare Workers are V8 isolates**, not containers. They start in milliseconds (not seconds), use minimal memory, and scale instantly. Perfect for AI applications that need low latency and high throughput.
</Callout>

## Post-Deployment

After deploying, verify your app works correctly:

### 1. Test the UI

Open your production URL and interact with the interface:

```bash
open https://<your-app>.deco.page
```

Verify:
- UI loads correctly
- Tools can be called from the UI
- Workflows execute successfully

### 2. Test the MCP Server

Add your production MCP server to the deco admin:

1. Go to [admin.decocms.com](https://admin.decocms.com)
2. Navigate to your workspace
3. Click **Integrations** → **Add Integration** → **Custom Integration**
4. Enter `https://<your-app>.deco.page/mcp`
5. Test tools in the AI chat interface

### 3. Verify Integrations

Check that external integrations (Gmail, Slack, etc.) work in production:
- OAuth credentials are configured correctly
- API keys are set in environment variables
- Rate limits are respected

<Callout type="warning">
  **Environment-specific configs**: Some integrations may require different credentials for production. Update them in your workspace settings at admin.decocms.com.
</Callout>

## Monitoring & Observability

deco provides built-in monitoring for your deployed apps:

### Logs

View real-time logs in the dashboard:
1. Go to [admin.decocms.com](https://admin.decocms.com)
2. Navigate to your app
3. Click **Logs** to see request logs, errors, and traces

### Analytics

Track usage metrics:
- Request count per tool/workflow
- Execution time
- Error rate
- Cost per operation

### Alerts

Set up alerts for:
- High error rates
- Slow response times
- Cost thresholds

## Updating Your App

Deploy updates as often as you like:

```bash
# Make changes to your code
# ...

# Deploy the update
npm run deploy
```

Deployments are **zero-downtime**:
- New version deploys alongside the old
- Traffic switches over atomically
- No service interruption

## Rollbacks

If something goes wrong, rollback to a previous version:

### Option 1: Promote a Previous Deployment

```bash
deco hosting list  # View deployment history
deco hosting promote -d <deployment-id>
```

### Option 2: Redeploy from Git

```bash
git checkout <previous-commit>
npm run deploy
```

<Callout type="tip">
  **Best practice**: Use Git tags for releases (e.g., `v1.0.0`). This makes rollbacks easier—just checkout the tag and redeploy.
</Callout>

## CI/CD Integration

Automate deployments with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or other CI/CD tools:

### Example: GitHub Actions

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '22'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      
      - name: Deploy
        run: npm run deploy -- -y -t ${{ secrets.DECO_API_TOKEN }}
        env:
          DECO_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DECO_API_TOKEN }}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Generate API tokens in your workspace settings at [admin.decocms.com](https://admin.decocms.com). Store them as secrets in your CI/CD platform.
</Callout>

## Custom Domains

Add a custom domain to your app:

1. Go to your workspace at [admin.decocms.com](https://admin.decocms.com)
2. Navigate to your app settings
3. Click **Domains** → **Add Custom Domain**
4. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

Example:
- Before: `https://my-app.deco.page`
- After: `https://app.yourdomain.com`

<Callout type="warning">
  Custom domains require DNS configuration. Follow the instructions in the admin dashboard carefully.
</Callout>

## Performance Best Practices

### Optimize Frontend
- Use code splitting for large apps
- Lazy load routes and components
- Optimize images (WebP, proper sizing)
- Enable compression (automatically handled by Cloudflare)

### Optimize Backend
- Cache frequently-used data
- Batch database queries
- Use parallel execution for independent operations
- Set appropriate timeout limits

### Database
- Index frequently queried columns
- Avoid N+1 queries
- Use transactions for multi-step operations
- Keep database queries simple and fast

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment fails

Check:
- You're logged in (`deco login`)
- Workspace is configured (`deco configure`)
- No TypeScript errors (`npm run check`)
- Build succeeds locally (`npm run build`)

### App doesn't load

Check:
- Deployment completed successfully
- No runtime errors in logs
- Environment variables are set correctly
- Integrations are configured for production

### Tools/workflows fail in production

Check:
- API keys are set in production environment
- OAuth credentials are configured correctly
- Database migrations are applied
- External services are reachable from Cloudflare Workers
