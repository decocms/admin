## What is deco CMS?

**Deco CMS** is an open-source Context Management System, the MCP Mesh for AI. It enables teams to build, deploy, and manage AI-native applications through unique collaboration between business users and developers.

> Think **Lovable + n8n + LangGraph**, running on Cloudflare with a single deploy command. Full-stack AI, production-ready.

## Value Proposition

deco CMS bridges the gap between AI prototypes and production systems:

- **For AI Builders:** Natural-language builder for business users to prototype and deploy AI apps without code
- **For Context Engineers:** Open-source TypeScript SDK for developers to extend, customize, and self-host
- **Seamless Collaboration:** Both users work together in the same platform with shared context

## Architecture at a Glance

deco CMS is built on two foundational layers:

### 1. MCP Mesh (The Kernel)

The backbone that manages context, connections, and observability for everything in your system.

- **Compose and secure MCPs** across your organization
- **Connect and proxy external MCPs** with secure tokens
- **Expose governed Virtual MCPs** ("AI Apps") to any MCP client
- **Enforce auth/RBAC/audit/FinOps** at every layer
- **Get full observability** across the entire stack

### 2. AI App Framework (Virtual MCPs in the Mesh)

Build AI-native web software that calls tools:

- **Full-stack**: From database to UI with React 19 + Tailwind v4
- **Generative Admin**: _deco chat_ helps you write PRDs and implement
- **Admin, workflows and custom views** governed by the Mesh

## Core Building Blocks

### Tools

Functions that perform actions like API calls, database queries, or computations.

```typescript
createTool({
  id: "CEP_SEARCH",
  description: "Search Brazilian postal codes",
  inputSchema: z.object({ cep: z.string() }),
  outputSchema: z.object({ city: z.string(), state: z.string() }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => { /* ... */ },
});
```

### Agents

AI assistants that understand natural language and call tools. Customizable with:
- Model selection (GPT-5, Claude, etc.)
- System prompts
- Tool access
- Resource context

### Workflows

Deterministic tool sequences for automation. Unlike agents that decide, workflows follow predefined steps.

```typescript
createWorkflow({ id: "REGISTER_CUSTOMER" })
  .then(validateInput)
  .then(saveToDatabase) 
  .then(sendWelcomeEmail)
  .commit();
```

### Views

Custom React interfaces for your tools and workflows. Built with React 19 + Tailwind v4.

### Documents

Markdown content (PRDs, guides, notes) attachable to agents / any thread for context.

### Resources

Everything in deco CMS is a resource: tools, agents, workflows, views, and documents. Resources are:
- Typed with Zod schemas
- Stored in deconfig (git-like versioning)
- Referenceable using `@` mentions in threads and agent system prompts

### Database

Built-in SQLite with Drizzle ORM for data persistence.

### MCP Mesh

Context aggregation layer that unifies integrations, tools, and policies:
- External MCP proxy
- Secure credential storage
- RBAC and policy routing
- OpenTelemetry tracing
- Cost tracking

## Who is deco CMS for?

**AI Builders:** Product managers, ops teams, business analysts building apps without code

**Context Engineers:** Developers extending with TypeScript, self-hosting, building custom integrations

## Why deco CMS?

AI teams are stuck between low-code prototypes and production chaos. Backends in n8n or LangGraph. Frontends in Lovable or React. Separate deployments. Inconsistent auth. Spiraling costs.

**deco CMS unifies everything:**

- 🧠 **MCP-native**, Compose servers with built-in policy, auth, observability
- ⚙️ **Full-stack TypeScript**, Agents, workflows, UIs in one repo
- 🌍 **Deploy anywhere**, Cloudflare Workers, AWS, or local runtimes
- 🔐 **Governance built-in**, RBAC, audit trails, spend caps
- 🔭 **Unified observability**, Trace UI → agents → models
- 🧩 **Open & modular**, Install from deco store or build your own
